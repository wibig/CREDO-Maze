 <B>Roland Maze</B></font><font size=+1>
 was a co-discoverer of Extensive Air Showers of cosmic rays.
 The array built by him on the roof of Ecole Normale Superieure
 in Paris enabled the observation of simultaneous registrations of high
 energy particles in two detectors separated by ~30 m. 
 His name has been placed together with the name of Pierre Auger in the 
headers
 of the <a href="am1.ps">first papers of 1938</a>  reporting about the discovery.
<br>

 At the beginning of the fifties, when the cosmic ray laboratory in Lodz
 was being formed, Roland Maze closely collaborated with Polish
 physicists. It is not easy to estimate nowadays his role in creation
 of the Lodz group and its first scientific achievements. He was together 
 with Aleksander Zawadzki, Juliusz Hibner, Jerzy Gawin
 and Jerzy Wdowczyk (among others) the co-author of many papers, which 
established
 the position of Lodz among distinguished centres of high energy physics in 
the world.<br>

 Comparing the scale and goals of presented further project with those
 of the international and over 100 mln $ Auger Project, it seems justified 
 to call our enterprise with the name of Roland Maze, as a tribute to  
 this great scientist.<br></font></td>

    <center><font size=+2><b>Concept of the Maze project</b></font></center> <br>
<font size=+1> In the proposed experiment detection points would be placed in the 
buildings
 (or better on the roofs) 
of Lodz high schools. Their net is dense enough (see Figure beside)
 to enable observation of particles starting from energies of 10<sup>18</sup>eV,
 for which expected frequency of interesting registrations is much greater
 (several thousands times) than for cases from the narrow region above
 10<sup>20</sup>eV. So one can expect first interesting experimental results 
already
 in the preliminary stage of realisation of the project with a small number
 of detection points. While the large experiments are dedicated exclusively 
 to big science, in our project each station (school) would constitute 
autonomous
 air shower array. Small, but developed enough to provide results which 
could
 themselves serve as material to interesting studies related to cosmic ray 
 physics and to independent developing of data analysis methods.<br>


For available spacing between detectors in a station (of the order of 
~10 m) 
 the chance of observing highest energy showers in one separate station is 
very small,
 but a special trigger system may provide full efficiency of registration 
of showers
 with energies ~ 10<sup>15</sup>eV falling on the detection area 
(100 m<sup>2</sup>).
 For a specific realisation (discrimination levels) one can obtain sensible 
 frequency of events counted in 1 min<sup>-1</sup>.<br>

 To enable independent observations in a separate station (high school) 
each 
 of them should be equipped with 4 scintillation counters of area
 ~ 1 m<sup>2</sup>.
 The electronic system should enable measurement of relative times with 
accuracy
 of ~ 5 ns (that would give angular resolution of ~ 5<sup>o</sup>) and
 measurement of 
signal amplitudes from all the detectors.
<br>
The system of converters and
master elaboration  would be connected to a PC-class computer, on which
preliminary data analysis  and storing would be performed. The scheme of a
single detection station is shown  in the figure.
<br>
 
To enable coordination of work of all the stations, which is the essence of 
described
 project, the GPS system seems at the moment the best for time 
synchronization.
 In the standard version GPS provides absolute time with sufficient 
accuracy
 (~300 ns) to synchronize events in different station. It seems
reasonable  to increase accuracy to several nanoseconds 
to enable additional
determination of particle direction in cases of  simultaneous registrations 
in
several stations, that are expected for the highest  energy showers, 
studies
of which are the main scientific goal of this project.<br>

 Communication between stations  
would be realised via Internet (see the figure to the right).
 Permanent connection to the net is not demanded, as the data stored in
 computer memory can be only once per some time sent to the central server.
 The server would put the data in some order, store and archivise them,
 and make accessible for each group on demand.
 In this way each group taking part in the realisation of the project would 
be
 able to independently analyse the whole gathered data and perform its own 
original
 studies.
