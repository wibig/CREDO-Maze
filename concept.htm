 <B>Why Maze?</B></font><font size=+1>
Roland Maze was the co-discoverer of Extensive Air Showers.
The array he built on the roof of the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris
 enabled the observation of simultaneous registrations of high-energy particles
 high-energy particles in two detectors separated  by ~30 m. 
His name was  placed together with the name of Pierre Auger in the 
headers  of the <a href="am1.ps">first</a> and <a href="am1.ps">second</a> papers of 1938 reporting the discovery.
<br>
Comparing the scale of our project with the
 Pierre Auger Observatory array, it seems justified to name our venture after  Roland Maze, as a tribute to this great scientist. <br></font></td>

There is among the high school students a great interest in natural sciences, in particular in physics, but
there are not enough opportunities for them to participate actively in experimental processes and discussions
on contemporary scientific issues. Despite the participation of pupils in cutting-edge research activities has
many advantages, the involvement of pupils and students with research activities in the field of physics and
astroparticle physics is confined to short visits to large research centers and to the attendance to demonstration
experiments and outreach lectures. Initiatives for the active involvement of teachers and their students
in the experimental processes of particle and astroparticle physics are emerging worldwide. We would like
to follow towards this direction offering extensive educational program based on the delivered to the highschool
small local EAS arrays. Its construction is designed to allow for the study of the parameters of
showers on the one hand, and on the other hand to be used in school classes in the standard curricula. The
four detectors allow students to measure the so-called decoherence curve. Thus, to reconstruct the famous
Auger and Maze experiment on the roof of ´ Ecole Normale Sup´erieure, where the Extensive Air Showers
were discovered19. Some milestone experiments of Rossi can be also recreated. The Rossi transition curve,
attenuation of muons, with the slightly modified coincidence circuit there is possible to study even the muon
decay.
	    <br>
Students using the data from their own array can get some results, but using data in possessions of
other schools in the region will learn, how to combine their own results, and see, how working together and
multiplying the statistics to achieve the accuracy which provide, e.g., the analysis of the spectrum index
successful.
	    <br>
One of the important parameters of proposed equipment is the cost. It is easy to build expensive and
complicated, 100% effective professional array. We are on the way of building the prototype which cost
(including scintillators, SiPMs, trigger electronics, storage and data transmission micro-computer) is below
200$ (compared to, e.g., 3000 EUR per detector for Cosmics detector in muCosmic detectors). Prototypes of individual elements
of the apparatus have been largely developed independently in several partner academic centres: University
of Lodz, National Centre for Nuclear Studies and Institute of Nuclear Physics in Poland, Institute of
Experimental and Applied Physics, in Czech Republic, Swinburne University of Technology in Australia.
Completion of the whole and its technical adaptation for replication will be one of the interesting tasks of the
project.It is an interesting concept to deliver to some of the end-users (schools) kits, which are adapted for
this purpose, assembled only in basic, skill-intensive parts. This would allow students in their local project
groups to build and assemble from them a fully operational and efficient whole, under the supervision, of
course, of the staff of the institutes managing the local project networks. The independent construction of
the operating scientific equipment is an additional motivating element and undoubtedly increases the involvement
of young people and the general interest of those not participating in the project. These effects
were observed in previous attempts to implement similar activities on a smaller scale.
	    <br>
	    On the other side it should be mentioned that proposed devices are designed and implemented in such a
way that, while maintaining high standards, they are as inexpensive as possible. Technologies will be developed
to ensure that the measurement kits can be duplicated and distributed to end users as ”self-assembly
kits” with different degrees of sophistication of the finished components. As potential business projects
they will be able, together with educational material pledges and software, to provide a ready-made market
product. With positive recommendations based on our research results, the potential market, the demand of
educational institutions, seems to be quite considerable.
	    <br>
The creation of local structures comprising young people involved and organised in research groups (led
by teachers/educators) using network communication and based on science centres, as, e.g., higher education
institutions, universities, is an important step in the development and institutional activities research
performing organisations, including , as well as research funding organisations. The proposed actions open
up new areas of innovation in non-formal non-school education. Creating a model system of social communication
networks and demonstrating its effectiveness in the proposed field being an element of STEM will
allow to plan and create similar networks realized in other areas of education. There are no contraindications
for such networks to cover various groups of young people and research centres.
