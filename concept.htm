 <B>Why Maze?</B></font><font size=+1>
Roland Maze was the co-discoverer of Extensive Air Showers.
The array he built on the roof of the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris
 enabled the observation of simultaneous registrations of high-energy particles
 high-energy particles in two detectors separated  by ~30 m. 
His name was  placed together with the name of Pierre Auger in the 
headers  of the <a href="am1.ps">first</a> and <a href="am1.ps">second</a> papers of 1938 reporting the discovery.
<br>
Comparing the scale of our project with the
 Pierre Auger Observatory array, it seems justified to name our venture after  Roland Maze, as a tribute to this great scientist. <br><br>

The Cosmic Ray Extremely Distributed Observatory
(CREDO) Project is a large international enterprise, now consisting of
19 countries, involving many scientific and educational institutions. The main scientific
objective of CREDO is the detection of so-called Cosmic Ray Ensembles. These are beams
of cosmic rays of very high energy, producing simultaneous extensive air showers across
the exposed surface of the Earth. Such a phenomenon has never been seen, but there are
several models in which such an event is possible. A system operating on a global scale is
needed to observe such events.
	    <br><br>
The concept of the CREDO-Maze array was developed based on the 20 years old Roland Maze Project10,11.
The technology today has developed greatly and the local shower array idea of Linsley12 can now be implemented
much more easily and, critically, much more cheaply. Eventually we wish to present high-schools
with sets of at least four professional cosmic ray detectors connected locally and forming the small school
EAS array.
	<br><br>
The project will create a global, unique physical apparatus, which will consist of a network of local
(school) measuring stations. Some similar attempts was introduced in some locations at the end of previous
millennium - the best known example is the High School Project on Astrophysics Research with Cosmics
(HiSPARC) in the Netherlands; as well as <a href="others.htm">WALTA, NALTA, ALTA, SALTA, CZELTA,SKALTA,
	CHICOS, MARIACHI</a>, but with no ambitions to get further, to the global scale. Some of them are
ephemeral, some are in a different phase of realization.
	    <br><br>
There is a belief that conducting research and experiments in particle and high-energy
physics is reserved only for scientists from scientific centres with powerful research facilities.
However, anyone can use the constant and uniform bombardment of the Earth’s surface
with cosmic rays to study the properties of high-energy particles (especially muons),
test relativity (e.g. the twin paradox) or monitor the impact of space weather id. Such
experiments can be offered to children as part of a range of school lessons as well as
extracurricular activities. Similar activities are regularly undertaken and described in the
literature.	
	    <br><br>
	    Some of these works are experiments performed with single cosmic ray muons, which
are very numerous and highly penetrable However, it would be most attractive to study
a phenomenon called Extension Air Shower (EAS) - a cascade of elementary particles
travelling at the speed of light (almost) from the upper layers of the Earth’s atmosphere
to the surface, where we can see them. They arrive in a very short instant as a disk of
particles (millions or even a billions). The source of such very high-energy particles that
initiated such a showers is in general unknown, as is the mechanism of their acceleration
in astrophysical sources.	    <br><br>

	    The presented idea of international cooperation necessary for the global character of the project has been
favourably received in several academic institutions, which we have asked for an opinion. We received clear
support from some Spanish regions, from research centers in Turkey, Czech Republic, Australia, Thailand,
Ukraine and Poland of course. They would have been willing to undertake a joint venture, which is mainly
focused on educational purposes. These Institutions are ready to create, maintain and operate the local
network of school mini-arrays and take care of the young people, organize after-hour activities and pilot
their scientific projects.
