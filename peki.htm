<!-- Dzis jestesmy sobie w stanie
wyobrazic go sobie bez wiekszych problemow. Czastka elementarna wpada w
atmosfere i tam zderza sie z jakim atomowym jadrem (azotu, tlenu, moze argonu
albo i z jakims innym, co jest jednak bardzo malo prawdopodobne).
W wyniku takiego zderzenia powstaja inne czastki, ktore lecac dalej znow
zderzaja sie z czym popadnie i tak to trwa, dopoki energii wystarczy, aby
cokolwiek nowego wyprodukowac.-->



The Extensive Air Shower, when it finally reaches the earth's surface, consists of a multitude of particles, 
	the vast majority of which are particles interacting mainly through electromagnetic forces. 
	These are electrons and their antiparticles: positrons, and also high-energy photons called 
	gamma quanta. They form the electromagnetic ("soft") component of the shower. It is 
	characterized by the fact that it is absorbed quite quickly in matter. Apart from these 
	particles, there are also a lot of particles in the shower that are heavier equivalents 
	(like brothers) of the electron, called muons. They are not found in ordinary matter around us, 
	because they are by nature very unstable. At rest, they decay on average after 0.0000022 seconds
	into electrons and a couple of corresponding neutrinos. However, for a hundred years we have known, 
	thanks to Albert Einstein, that time flows differently in moving reference systems (this is called
	the theory of relativity). When a muon is moving with respect to us at a high speed, 
	it "lives" from our resting point of view longer

	For a speed of 0.98% of the speed of light, which is a typical speed of muons in the shower, 
	this gives a factor 50 and as a result the average lifetime of such a muon will be ~0.0001 
	second. During this time it can fly 30 km, so it can easily reach us together with the shower. 
	By the way, the presence of muons in the shower is an obvious proof of the validity 
	of the theory of relativity (if anyone had any doubts about it).
Muons, similarly to electrons, are leptons, which means that they interact basically only 
	electromagnetically, and as they are about 200 times heavier than electrons, with 
	each scattering on an electron or atomic nucleus they lose correspondingly 200<sup><font
size=-1>2</font></sup>
	times less energy. In general, they only knock electrons out of atoms - they ionize matter. 
	Muons in showers form their component called penetrating (hard). They are able to break 
	through thick layers of earth, concrete or even lead.

 <b>origin of the shower</b>
<br><br>
A EAS can only be initiated at the top of the atmosphere by a stable  particle, 
	one that has not decayed during its journey from the depths of space. 
	Among elementary particles, only the lightest members of certain groups 
	can be absolutely stable (at least it seems so). These groups are 
	distinguished by special properties, which must be preserved during 
	disintegration (an example of such a property is electric charge, 
	which cannot disappear just like that. A charged particle must 
	decay, if it must necessarily decay to another, lighter particle, 
	but also charged and with exactly the same charge!) The lightest 
	charged leptons are the electron (negative) and the positron (positive). 
	The lightest electromagnetic and electrically uncharged particle is the photon. 
	It has no (rest) mass at all. The lightest particle with a so-called baryon charge 
	is the proton. Atomic nuclei consisting of protons and neutrons are 
	also (sometimes) stable. We observe their permanence every day, for 
	example sitting on a chair, which does not seem to disintegrate 
	(by itself).<br>
In order for a Extensive Air Shower to form, the particle that initiates it must 
	not only survive the long journey, but still have sufficient energy at the end of it. 
	It turns out that electrons (and positrons) are too light  are too light not to lose almost 
	all the energy they have gained somewhere far away in the 
	mysterious and not fully understood processes of producing  and accelerating cosmic rays as they traverse the magnetic fields of the Galaxy. 
	They are deflected in these fields, and every charge moving with accelerated motion (with some acceleration) 
	emits electromagnetic radiation (this is how TV and your mobile phone work!), and this can only happen at the 
	expense of its kinetic energy. This, of course, does not apply to uncharged particles. So, if photons were to
	fly out from cosmic ray sources, they would have some chance of causing a shower in the Earth's atmosphere. 
	In fact, we do not know whether this is the case. 
	Very high-energy photons are still one of the mysteries of cosmic ray physics.
	
 <br><hr><br>
 <b>electromagnetic cascade</b><br>


<br>
	Let us assume that somewhere high up such a photon has appeared. Passing near some electric charge (most often it 
	will be an atomic nucleus) it has a big chance to turn into an electron-positron pair. It is a process (in some sense) 
	opposite to annihilation of matter and antimatter. Annihilation consists in the fact that matter meeting antimatter turns 
	into "pure" energy. This idea is known to the fans of sci-fi, where on great interstellar cruisers it constitutes a terrible
	and ultimate weapon in the fight between good and evil, turning whole planets into (interstellar) dust in a cosmic explosion.
	This is of course a slight exaggeration (for today), but the fact is that the positron is the antiparticle of the electron. 
	Such a pair as a whole has electric charge (and all other quantum numbers which must conserve) equal to zero, so nothing stands
	in the way of its suddenly appearing "from nothing", if only this "nothing" (photon) has enough energy to lose. As a result of
	such an interaction, the entering photon is transformed into two particles (electrically charged with exactly opposite charges),
	which carry with them (almost) all of its energy. These energies are large enough to produce new particles in subsequent collisions.
	
<br>Electrons (for positrons everything looks exactly the same - at high energies the sign of the electric charge does not play much
	of a role) passing near heavy (from their point of view) and sometimes quite considerably electrically charged nuclei
	of atoms of the air must deflect their path in their electric (magnetic - it depends how to look at it) fields. So, 
	according to all principles described very precisely by the so-called quantum electrodynamics (QED), experiencing 
	accelerations they must emit photons. On the same principle works, as already mentioned, television, with the
	only small difference that electromagnetic waves of television transmitters treated as photons have very tiny energies.<br>
	The energy of photons in a Extensive Air Shower depends, of course, on the energy of the electron, but also on the angle at
	which it is scattered. Often the newly created photon carries an energy comparable to that of the incoming electron. We 
	say that in such a reaction a high-energy brehmsstrahlung ('breaking') photon was created,
	because the electron almost stopped - the energy is still carried by the photon, and under suitable conditions it can change
	again into an electron-positron pair, and everything starts from the beginning. And this lasts as long as particles in this
	electromagnetic cascade have enough energy to create next generations of particles.<br>
	<img src="kaskada_toy.png" width="500"
        alt="kask">
<br>When the energies of particles in the cascade are decreasing, other processes of energy loss start to play an important role, such
	as various scattering, ionization of atoms of the medium, the photoelectric effect and a few more. The electromagnetic 
	cascade after reaching the maximum of its development begins to disappear. Whether it disappears completely before reaching 
	the ground level depends, of course, on what energy the particle had at the beginning. It is fortunate that from an energy of about 
	10<sup><font size=-1>14-15</font></sup> eV we can already see at sea level electromagnetic cascades passing through the entire 
	thickness of the Earth's atmosphere.
	
	
	
	
	
	
<br><hr><br>
<b>what is it all for and what does it involve</b>
<br><br>
The Extensive Air Showers are of interest to us because we want to know the answer to two questions:
<li>
	What is our Universe made of ?  Specifically, what actually reaches the boundaries of our atmosphere?
	</li><li>
How is our Universe made ? And more specifically: what are the laws that govern the microworld?
	</li>
On this second point:<br>
It is likely that a machine colliding elementary particles with (laboratory) energies of  10<sup><font
size=-1>20</font></sup> eV will never be created 
	under Earth laboratory conditions.
	The only source of data on how matter behaves in such extreme states will 
	be the observation of EAS. The image of the shower recorded at the surface reflects (in a very convoluted 
	way) how many and which particles are produced in the high-energy interactions, and how widely they are scattered. 
	QCD, when it finally emerges, will have to describe the showers too. And when it fails to describe them? 
	(That's going to be interesting!)
<br>
	And in the first one:<br>
We know that the particles of the primary cosmic radiation have gigantic energies. And this is actually the only thing 
	we know for sure about them. What we know today is that we don't know where they are coming from. We know that 
	we do not know whether they are individual protons - nuclei of hydrogen atoms - or nuclei of, for example, iron. 
	Hydrogen occurs in the Universe in slightly (?) different (?) places than iron. And how did such nuclei get their 
	enormous energies? We have no idea. These are the things in the sky, about which, mainly for lack of knowledge, we 
	cannot even dream. And we would probably like to.<br>
We would like to know, by observing simultaneous signals from the detectors of a huge, shower arrays, what has really happened.
