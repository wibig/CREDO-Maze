Cosmic rays is the phenomenon known for over a hundred years, but so far its origin, acceleration and variability
mechanisms are not clear in details. Many questions about, e.g., the cosmic weather and the impact
of cosmic radiation on humans and human activities have not yet been answered definitively. Extensive
Air Showers (EAS)2 are initiated by a single cosmic ray particle interacting in the upper atmosphere and
creating a cascade of elementary particles traveling to the surface of the Earth. They arrive as a disk of
millions of particles for one short instance. Recently there has been proposed an even larger shower-like
event, so-called Cosmic Ray Ensembles3, in which bundles of ultra high energy cosmic rays can produce
simultaneous showers over the entire exposed surface of the Earth. Such a phenomenon has never been seen,
but there are several models under which such an event is a possibility, including the decay/annihilation of
superheavy dark matter particles4. Searching for such hypothesized Cosmic Ray Ensembles (CRE) is the
driving science case behind the CREDO Project5. It formally commenced operations on Sept. 11, 2019
after approximately three years of network and software infrastructure development6. By design it was
imagined as a global research endeavor, and currently consists of 17 countries involving many scientific and
educational institutions7,8.
	<br>
The CREDO infrastructure centers around correlating myriad cosmic ray data from any apparatus around
the world, including professional instruments, educational detectors and arrays, and popular devices such as
smartphones6,9.
	<br>
The concept of the CREDO-Maze array was developed based on the 20 years old Roland Maze Project10,11.
The technology today has developed greatly and the local shower array idea of Linsley12 can now be implemented
much more easily and, critically, much more cheaply. Eventually we wish to present high-schools
with sets of at least four professional cosmic ray detectors connected locally and forming the small school
EAS array.
	<br>
The project will create a global, unique physical apparatus, which will consist of a network of local
(school) measuring stations. Some similar attempts was introduced in some locations at the end of previous
millennium - the best known example is the High School Project on Astrophysics Research with Cosmics
(HiSPARC) in the Netherlands; as well as <a href="others.htm">WALTA, NALTA, ALTA, SALTA, CZELTA,SKALTA,
	CHICOS, MARIACHI</a>, but with no ambitions to get further, to the global scale. Some of them are
ephemeral, some are in a different phase of realization.
	<br>
Our project uses technologically sophisticated measuring equipment in extracurricular activities: detectors
of charged relativistic elementary particles will be made of small (0.02 m2) plastic scintillators. The
light pulses will be collected by optical fibers shifting the wavelength from ultraviolet to green and then light
will be converted into electric signals by Silicone Photomultipliers. Further electronics will be based on high
speed digital circuits and microcontrollers to connect to higher-level servers via the Internet and WiFi links.
Prototypes of individual components of the apparatus have been largely developed independently by several
intitutions.
	<br>
The presented idea of international cooperation necessary for the global character of the project has been
favourably received in several academic institutions, which we have asked for an opinion. We received clear
support from some Spanish regions, from research centers in Turkey, Czech Republic, Australia, Thailand,
Ukraine and Poland of course. They would have been willing to undertake a joint venture, which is mainly
focused on educational purposes. These Institutions are ready to create, maintain and operate the local
network of school mini-arrays and take care of the young people, organize after-hour activities and pilot
their scientific projects.
