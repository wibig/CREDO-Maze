Cosmic rays is the phenomenon known for over a hundred years, but so far its origin, acceleration and variability
mechanisms are not clear in details. Many questions about, e.g., the cosmic weather and the impact
of cosmic radiation on humans and human activities have not yet been answered definitively. Extensive
Air Showers (EAS) are initiated by a single cosmic ray particle interacting in the upper atmosphere and
creating a cascade of elementary particles traveling to the surface of the Earth. They arrive as a disk of
millions of particles for one short instance. Recently there has been proposed an even larger shower-like
event, so-called Cosmic Ray Ensembles, in which bundles of ultra high energy cosmic rays can produce
simultaneous showers over the entire exposed surface of the Earth. Such a phenomenon has never been seen,
but there are several models under which such an event is a possibility, including the decay/annihilation of
superheavy dark matter particles. Searching for such hypothesized Cosmic Ray Ensembles (CRE) is the
driving science case behind the CREDO Project5. It formally commenced operations on Sept. 11, 2019
after approximately three years of network and software infrastructure development6. By design it was
imagined as a global research endeavor, and currently consists of 17 countries involving many scientific and
educational institutions.
	<br><br>
The CREDO infrastructure centers around correlating myriad cosmic ray data from any apparatus around
the world, including professional instruments, educational detectors and arrays, and popular devices such as
smartphones.
	<br><br>
Our project uses technologically sophisticated measuring equipment in extracurricular activities: detectors
	of charged relativistic elementary particles will be made of small (0.02 m<sup><font size=+0>2</font></sup>) plastic scintillators. The
light pulses will be collected by optical fibers shifting the wavelength from ultraviolet to green and then light
will be converted into electric signals by Silicone Photomultipliers. Further electronics will be based on high
speed digital circuits and microcontrollers to connect to higher-level servers via the Internet and WiFi links.
Prototypes of individual components of the apparatus have been largely developed independently by several
intitutions.
